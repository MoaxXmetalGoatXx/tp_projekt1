## Overview

This project utilizes Arduino and three LDRs to control the behavior of a buzzer. The LDRs are used to detect light levels, which are then mapped to control the pitch, volume, and modulation of the buzzer.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An Arduino board
- Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs)
- A buzzer
- Arduino IDE installed on your computer

## Installation

1. Connect the components as per the circuit diagram.
2. Open the `ldr_buzzer_control.ino` sketch in the Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

## Usage

1. After uploading the sketch, open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to observe the values read from the LDRs and the corresponding pitch, volume, and modulation values.
2. Adjust the sensitivity of the LDRs by modifying the resistor values or the mapping ranges in the sketch to suit your requirements.
3. Experiment with different light conditions to see how it affects the buzzer's behavior.
